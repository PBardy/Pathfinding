# Pathfinding Simulator

## Description

This is a pathfinding simulation tool. Pathfinding is a form of traversing a graph via its edges to arrive from a source vertex to a destination vertex. The simulation represents such graphs via a grid, where each grid cell has an edge with its neighbouring empty cells. The simulation removes edges between vertices by adding walls (represented as grey cells).
